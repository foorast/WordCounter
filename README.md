# WordCounter
A tool that can be used in command line to print the number of words and lines within a .txt file.

** This tool is primarily for my own educational progress, however if you would like to use it for whatever reason be my guest. **

HOW TO USE:
  1. Make sure you have python downloaded on your machine.
  3. Open your command line.
  4. Run $ python3 ~/<directory>/./word_count.py ~/<directory>/./<File>.txt
      Example: Say my word_count.py is within my Downloads folder and my notes.txt file is within my Documents folder
      I would run - python3 ~/Downloads/./word_count.py ~/Documnets/./notes.txt

ENJOY!
